    <h1>Survival</h1>
    <h2>The Story of Owen Chase</h2>
        <p>By Octavius Szeto</p>
    <p>(So I will just copy and paste...)</p>
    <p>Even when it’s calm, the sea is a harsh environment for most any human to survive in. From the blazing sun (if you’re lucky) to the frightening clouds and thunder (if you’re not) to the harsh waters, no person can vouch for the dangers of the sea more than Owen Chase. His singular survivor’s instinct was tested numerous times during his tenure as first mate on the whale ship Essex, which launched in 1819, and went on to inspire Moby Dick.
Nothing about Chase’s voyage went well. After surviving storms that nearly destroyed the vessel, he was barely able to escape from a small island after a crew mate set a fire as a prank, only for the island to quickly become engulfed in flames. Chase was then tested once more when his ship was destroyed by an attacking sperm whale. The team of 20 men piled into their emergency boats and stuffed them with as many supplies as they could while the Essex took on water—after which the ship sank, and the really bad things began to happen.
While stranded at sea, the crew suffered yet another whale attack before finally managing to reach land. However, the crew soon realized the island was barren. While three men decided to say, the others chose to take their chances at sea. Their supplies soon ran out, at which point the crew resorted to drinking their own urine and, eventually, cannibalism, slaughtering their companions for nourishment.
Even this horrible tactic didn’t sustain them for long. When the boat was finally discovered by two passing ships, only five of the 17 men remaining in the boat were still alive. It is said that they were found sucking marrow from the bones of their dead crew mates.</p>

        <h2>The Story of Hugh Glass</h2>
        <p>By Octavius Szeto</p>
        <p>It was obvious from the very beginning that Hugh Glass’ journey with a company of fur trappers through the American wilderness in 1823 (now immortalized in The Revenant) would be treacherous. First, Native American attacks pushed the men from their path along the Missouri River. Seventeen lives had already been claimed by these ambushes, which also left Glass with a gunshot wound in the leg, and there was no telling when another attack was coming.
Then, while Glass was recovering from these attacks, he was mauled by a grizzly bear who ripped out a piece of his shoulder, tore at his throat, and mangled his foot. By the time his party had managed to reach him and help him kill the bear, they decided that he was a dead man.
With winter fast approaching, the team couldn’t afford to stay behind, instead deciding to cut a deal. Two of the party members were paid the hefty sum of $80 to stay with Glass until he died and to give him a proper burial. However, when five days had passed and Glass was still alive, the pair decided to strip him of all his belongings and leave him for dead.
After Glass regained consciousness, he had to tend to a broken leg, cuts that went down to the bone, and rotting flesh, the latter of which he treated by rolling in maggots, allowing them to eat the dead tissue. Then, he set about finding the men who left him behind.
He crawled, rafted, and walked through hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain, actually receiving some help from Native Americans along the way. And when he finally found the men who abandoned him, he forgave them and spared their lives, before promptly signing up for several more dangerous expeditions.</p>

        <h1>Exploration</h1>
        <h2>A few random explorations...</h2>
        <p>By Wikipedia</p>
        <h2>Phoenician Galley Sailings</h2>
        <p>The Phoenicians (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil's Aeneid and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa and founded the city of Carthage.</p>
        <h2>Carthaginian Exploration of Western Africa</h2>
        <p>Hanno the Navigator (500 BC), a Carthaginean navigator who explored the Western Coast of Africa.</p>
